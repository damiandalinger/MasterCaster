## Description

In MasterCaster, you start broke, with a dusty mic and no listener - but your dream is clear: become the world’s most iconic gaming podcaster.  
Read hilarious in-game news, invite fictional gaming legends as guests, manage your show’s tone and sponsors, and - even more controversially - unlock the dark web to boost your reach with questionable methods.

Explore unique features like:
- Podcast creation with evolving quality
- News that feeds your content strategy
- Guest interaction with branching outcomes
- Sponsorship deals to make big bucks
- Dark web missions with high risk & reward

This game was developed as a university project using Unity 6000.0.44f1 and C#.
