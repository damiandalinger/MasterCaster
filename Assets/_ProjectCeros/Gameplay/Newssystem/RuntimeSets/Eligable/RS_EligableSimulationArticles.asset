    Headline: The Deadly Secret of the Simulation Genre
    Description: One of our agency members has died. To honour his death we have
      decided to make the circumstances under which he died public. He was on the
      tail of a News Agency that apparently only works for simulation games and only
      ever releases positive news about them. After getting increasingly entangled
      we lost all contact with him until he was found dead.
